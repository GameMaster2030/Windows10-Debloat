First run powershell as **Administrator** and paste and run this: <code>Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force</code> 
This allows scripts to be run as they are blocked by default.
Now download **all** the files and run the ps1 file as administrator, and follow the steps. 

I rewrote some code as it wasn't correct. Original code: https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater/
